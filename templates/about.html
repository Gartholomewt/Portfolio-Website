                <p class="spaced-text">
                Hi, I’m Gary Tyree.<br><br>
                I'm a bioengineer and data engineer passionate about bridging the gap between biology and technology. With a strong background in research and development, I specialize in cell biology, bioinformatics, and data-driven problem-solving. My work has focused on optimizing biological systems through computational and experimental approaches. Outside of work, I enjoy coding, exploring scientific innovations, and refining my skills in software development and computational biology.                
                
                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>I’ve lived most of my life in Tucson, Arizona. I’ve only ever asked for one thing my entire life. Less sun and more rain. That’s it. I’m still holding onto that wish in the relatively cool San Diego. There’s never too much rain in my opinion! <br><br>Growing up in Tucson, I was always surrounded by the unique beauty of the Sonoran Desert. My education led me to develop an early interest in science and technology as my preferred toolset. Tucson instilled in me a love for discovery and problem-solving, but the desert’s harsh landscape made me never take nature for granted. This eventually guided me toward a career in engineering where I could improve human health and other biosystems.</p>
                
                <h2>University / Internships</h2>
                <p>During my university years, I focused on bioengineering and data science, honing my skills in computational biology, machine learning, and laboratory research. I worked on research projects involving biochemistry, genetics, evolutionary biology, systems biology, and even medical devices, gaining hands-on experience with design, experimental, and computational tools. Collaborating with interdisciplinary teams allowed me to develop a strong foundation in scientific research and data analysis, reinforcing my passion for using technology to advance biological sciences. During my Master’s, I went beyond my course requirements by independently writing a grant proposal on protein engineering using deep learning in plant systems. Driven by my passion for applying computational tools to complex biological challenges, I saw this as an opportunity to explore the future of synthetic biology and rational protein design.</p>
                
                <h2>Professional</h2>
                <p>After university, I transitioned into professional roles that allowed me to apply my expertise in bioengineering and data-driven research. I have worked on projects like electroporation devices cell therapy products, designing and implementing a biomedical startup’s data architecture, and data science pipelines for advanced analysis. My experience spans R&D, engineering, and consulting on data-driven strategies in biotechnology. I thrive in environments that challenge me to innovate, solve complex problems, and contribute to meaningful advancements in science and technology.</p>
